# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Before we Begin

### How to Play the Game

In the game-verse of this minesweeper re-imagining the galaxy has come under threat and you are our only hope for survival.
The Minedorians have strategically placed fusion reactor mines on
key planets of the Galactic Union which, if detonated, could mean
the end of all sentient life in the galaxy as we know it.
The mission is simple, clear all the planets represented on the
comms grid and if possible, eliminate the mines in the process. Our radars have been able to triangulate possible locations of the mines but they use sophisiticated cloaking which block us from getting their exact location.

Here is how you will proceed:
To start the mission simply select one of the planet cells on the comms grid. This will reaveal to you how many manies have been located in a single cell radius.
If you suspect a planet to be rigged with a mine, use the
righ-selector button of your selection device and it will flag
that planet for furhter inspection.

    It sounds fairly simple but it will require your genius to work
    out exactly where the mines have been planted.

    As soon as you have cleared all the planets or when all the mines have been flagged, the mission will be completed. The view-screen above the comms grid will indicate how many mines have been located.

### Dependencies

This project has two main dependencies that are required to run the app and might not run with `npm start`.
`npm install` should install all dependencies from the package.json but here are some more details about each dependency:

### React-Bootstrap

React bootstrap components are imported for this project. In order to render them run `npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap@5.1.3`.
For more information visit: https://react-bootstrap.github.io/getting-started/introduction/.

### React-Icons

Icons from react-icons are imported for this project. In order to render them run `npm install react-icons --save`.
For more information visit: https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
